# WSO2 IS Sample iOS Application
##### This is a sample iOS application developed to demostrate how to use the WSO2 Identity Server as an SSO provider. This application uses [AppAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS) which is an opensource library to communicate with [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) and [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) providers.
